Wiring:


Requirments and makefile setup:

    In order to make these files, you need to navigate to /usr/share/arduino/libraries
    and copy the Servo Library and copy it to /arduino-ua/libraries
    It is also necessary to download the virtualWire library from:
    https://platformio.org/lib/show/251/VirtualWire
    and place it in /arduino-ua/libraries.

    You then need to go into the provided arduino makefile and modify the entry that
    defines what user libraries to include in the make.
    To do this you simply add the name of the folders. it should now look like this:
    ARDUINO_LIBS = SD SPI Adafruit_GFX Adafruit_ILI9341 TouchScreen Servo VirtualWire
