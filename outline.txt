The Plan:

Part1:
objective: Implement a maze solving algorithm in python
steps:
	1: Generate pixel maze (10*10)
		1.1: https://hereandabove.com/maze/mazeorig.form.html *

	2: Analyze pixel maze in mazetograph.py
		2.1: - create data structure from image *
			 - find start and end
		2.2: put nodes on bends and junctions
		2.3: give node connections distance weighting

	3: implement algorith in pathfinding.py
		3.1: implement djikstras algorithm or a* or d*
		3.2: navigate the maze and output shortest path along nodes


Part2;
objective: Implement maze navigation in an arduino
steps:
	1: make robot
	2: make movement library/api for robot
	3: make physical maze
	4: implement bluetooth data read in
